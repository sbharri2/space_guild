# Space Guilds - Game Concept Overview

## Vision Statement
Space Guilds is a text-first, mobile-friendly multiplayer game where small guilds of players (2-3 captains each) explore a galaxy of interconnected warp nodes, upgrade their ships, build planets into guild bases, and face daily AI-driven crises.

## Core Pillars

### 1. Exploration
- Discovering new planets, resources, technologies, and NPCs
- Warp-node galaxy system with interconnected jump points
- Memory drives for fast travel to discovered systems

### 2. Chaos & Social Storytelling
- Players submit actions (serious or silly)
- AI-DM combines them into galactic narratives
- Embraces absurdity with "yes, and..." philosophy

### 3. Progression & Upgrades
- Personal ship progression and fleet building
- Guild base development on claimed planets
- Long-term reputation and influence systems

## Target Experience
- Daily sessions: 10-20 minutes
- Focus on memorable stories over perfect play
- Guild cooperation, negotiation, and betrayal
- Living galaxy that responds to player actions

## Development Phases

### Phase 1: MVP (Text-Only Prototype)
- 3 ship archetypes (Scout, Warship, Trader)
- Small guilds (2-3 players)
- 1-2 galaxy sectors with 6-12 warp nodes each
- Daily AI crisis system
- Basic exploration and discovery
- Simple progression (credits, reputation, ship upgrades)

### Phase 2: Enhanced Systems
- Full progression trees
- Multiple guild planets
- Complex faction relationships
- Seasonal campaigns and resets

### Phase 3: Visual Enhancement
- ASCII art upgrades to basic graphics
- Enhanced UI and animations
- Audio and music integration

## Success Metrics
- Player retention through engaging daily loops
- Memorable story generation by AI system
- Active guild participation and social dynamics
- Balanced progression without pay-to-win mechanics
